Steps to take:
- Clone the yolov5 repository (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) into src/yolov5
- (optional) adjust the paths in data/guidewiredetection_clinic.yaml to your training data (or better: create a new yaml file)
- Run the `run_experiment.sh` script for training and validation. Of course, you can also adjust the steps and hyperparameters there
